# EXPERIMENT NO - 08

* Aim: To explore and implement Multi-Dimensional Arrays in C++ for structured data storage and manipulation.

* Tools Used: IDE, nested loops, array indexing, operators, etc.

* Theory:

In C++, multi-dimensional arrays are used to store data in a tabular form (rows and columns) or higher dimensions. The most common type is the two-dimensional array, which can be visualized like a matrix. These arrays are useful for representing data such as game boards, tables, or pixel grids.

ðŸ”¹ 1.*Multi-Dimensional Arrays in C++:*

A multi-dimensional array is essentially an array of arrays, allowing storage of data in a table-like structure. The most common type is the two-dimensional array, which organizes elements in rows and columns for easy representation of matrices or grids. Multi-dimensional arrays are useful for solving problems involving structured data, such as tables, game boards, or image pixels.

* Elements are accessed using multiple indices.

* The first index refers to the row, and the second to the column.

* Useful for matrix operations, tables, and data mapping.

ðŸ”¸ Syntax:

    int arr[3][4]; // 3 rows, 4 columns
    
ðŸ”¸ Usage:

* Store tabular data like marks, grids, or coordinates

* Access elements using arr[row][column]

* Typically used with nested loops for traversal

ðŸ”¸ Example:


    int matrix[2][3] = {
       {1, 2, 3},
       {4, 5, 6}
    };

     for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        for(int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
           cout << matrix[i][j] << " ";
        }   
       cout << endl;
     }
ðŸ”¹ 2.*Higher Dimensional Arrays:*

3D arrays: Useful for storing data in the form of layers or cubes

ðŸ”¸Syntax:


    int cube[3][4][5];
    
Accessed using three indices: cube[x][y][z]

# Transpose Matrix:

A transpose of a matrix is formed by turning its rows into columns and columns into rows. If an element is at position (i, j) in the original matrix, it will move to position (j, i) in the transposed matrix. This concept is widely used in mathematical operations, computer graphics, and solving systems of equations.

*ALGORITHM:*

1> Start

2> Declare variables:
* rows, columns (int) â€“ for storing matrix dimensions

4> Using nested loops, read matrix elements into m[i][j]

5> Display the original matrix using nested loops

6> Display the transpose of the matrix by printing m[j][i] in nested loops

7> End

# Compare elements of first row to second row:

This program reads a matrix from the user and checks if any elements in the first row match with the corresponding elements in the second row. The matrix is displayed first for reference. Then, the program compares each element of the first row with the element in the same column of the second row. If at least one match is found, a confirmation message is displayed; otherwise, it reports that no matches exist.

*ALGORITHM:*

1> Start

2> Declare variables:

3> Input number of rows and columns from the user

4> Using nested loops, read matrix elements into m[i][j]

5> Display the matrix using nested loops

6> Initialize matchFound to false

7> Compare elements of first row and second row:

* Loop through each column j
  
* If m[0][j] == m[1][j], set matchFound = true and break the loop

8> If matchFound is true, display "Elements of first row match the elements of second row"
Else display "No elements match between the first and second row"

9> End

# Conclusion:

This experiment demonstrates how to create, store, and process data using multidimensional arrays in C++. We learned to perform various operations such as input/output of matrix elements, finding sums of diagonals, comparing rows, and generating transposes. It reinforced concepts of nested loops, index referencing, and logical conditions, providing a strong foundation for handling structured tabular data efficiently.
